<h1>Milestone 1 Overview</h1>
<h2>
    Purpose
</h2>
<p>What would you like your PWP to help you accomplish? This is a high-level goal akin to a Mission Statement.</p>
<h2>
    Audience
</h2>
<p>Who will be using or viewing your site? Who is this site designed for, and who is your audience comprised of? Could it be for your professional peers and other developers, potential employers, customers, or clients, etc.?</p>
<h2>
    Goal
</h2>
<p>This is should be a quantifiable goal if possible. For example, a goal for your PWP could be:

    To acquire full or part-time employment or an internship.
    To increase sales and/or conversion rates for an existing business.
    To attract freelance clients.
    To serve as a gallery to showcase and promote your work.
    To increase the reach of a new or established social media presence (as measured via analytics tools).
</p>

<h2>
    Persona
</h2>
<p>In your milestone-1.html file, define one persona that represents the primary target audience for your Personal Website. More information on how to create a persona for your project here: http://www.webcredible.com/blog-reports/web-usability/personas.shtml

    Frustrations your persona may be facing.
    Goal(s) regarding the use of your site.
    Additional information your persona may need in order to achieve their goal.
</p>

<h2>
    Summary
</h2>
<p>All written documentation should be created in valid, correct HTML markup inside the milestone-1.html file.
