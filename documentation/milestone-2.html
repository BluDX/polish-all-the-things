<body>
My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:

    <h2>
        Header, containing my links to Home, About Me, Working Title, and Contact
    </h2>

    <h2>
        Logo with my Brand Name
    </h2>

    <h2>
        About Me
    </h2>

<p>This section will contain a history of how I got started with nail art, some information about my collection, and what all I paint with polish.  The tone will be friendly and casual because this is for my hobby page, and it's meant to be fun and inviting more than professional.</p>

<h2>
    Working Title
</h2>

<p>This is where I will have photos with captions of different things I do with nail polish.  Eventually, it would be nice if this could be a homepage to my website.  I make press-on nails and nail decals and jewelry to sell.</p>

<h2>
    Contact
</h2>

<p>This section will contain a contact form, my shop's email address, and additional links to my hobby social media profiles: Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok</p>

<h2>
    Footer, containing icon links to my socials (also listed above)
</h2>

<h2>
    Mobile Wireframe
</h2>
